## Introduction

One project that shows how to include a machine learning model into a Flask web application is the House Price Prediction Web Application. The application allows users to input different house attributes and, using the trained model, provides an estimated house price.

## Features: 

- Offers an easy-to-use web interface for entering home characteristics
- Makes use of a machine learning model to forecast house price values depending on the features entered
- Displays the predicted house price to the user


## Code Structure

### The project's code structure is as follows:
- `app.py`: The main Flask application file, handling routing and model integration.
- `templates/index.html`: The HTML template for the web interface.
- `models/house_price_model.pkl`: The serialized machine learning model.
- `data/housing_data.csv`: The dataset used to train the machine learning model.
- `requirements.txt`: The list of Python dependencies for the project.
- `README.md`: The project's documentation, which you're currently reading.
